# Scala Design-by-Contract

Design-by-contract is a powerful, somewhat less known, technique to improve software quality. 
General information can be found in the wiki:
[Wiki](https://github.com/timroberts/sdbc/wiki)

The **goals** of this repo are as follows:
* Document via examples the built-in, but less commonly known, DbC features of Scala. For example, Predef.ensuring
* Document patterns such as trait based specs. These are contained in the test pacakge.
* Collect a robust implementation of missing features such as invariants. These are in the main dir.
* Capture discussions and documents regarding implementation, trade-offs and growth scenarios around DbC in scala

Feel free to contribute to these goals.
